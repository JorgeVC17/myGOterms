Description: The GOTermAnalysis function facilitates GO term enrichment analysis on a dataset of differentially expressed genes, identifying enriched biological processes for either upregulated or downregulated genes based on specified log fold change and adjusted p-value thresholds, while the cytogeneticbandToEntrex function maps a specified cytogenetic band to corresponding Entrez gene IDs by filtering a list of genes based on their chromosomal band annotations.
